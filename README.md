# Lazy

Whenever I have a new project for implementing GitHub in the enterprise levels, setting up a engagement issues, milestones are the first thing to do. 

But I'm lazy, I like to populate quickly.

This is the project.


### How to run

gh my-github-extension -reponame "username/repository" -token "your_github_token" -tasks "tasks/tasks.json"
