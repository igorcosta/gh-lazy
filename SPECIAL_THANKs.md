# 🎉 Special Thanks: Our Lazy Heroes! 🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️

> Because even the laziest projects need a little help from their friends!

## 🚀 Inspiration Station

### 📂 [files-to-prompt](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Apr/8/files-to-prompt/)
A Python package that made us go, "Hey, we can do that in Go!" And so we did, because why reinvent the wheel when you can just... roll with it? 🎳

### 🌟 [Awesome Go CLI repo](https://awesome-go.com/standard-cli/)
The treasure trove of CLI goodness that made us realize we're not alone in our quest for terminal domination. It's like a candy store, but for code! 🍭

## 🛠️ Tools of Mass Laziness

- [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra): For making our CLI roar with power! 🐍
- [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper): Because even lazy projects need to stay hydrated with configuration goodness. 🐍💧
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/): Our gateway to GitHub glory, right from the comfort of our terminals. 🐙

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 The Lazy Community

A big shoutout to all the developers out there who believe in the power of automation and the art of doing more by doing less. You're the real MVPs (Most Valuable Procrastinators)! 🏆

## 🎨 Art Department

Special thanks to our art department (read: ASCII art generators and emoji keyboards) for making our CLI look fabulous without us having to learn actual design skills. 🎨🖌️

## ☕ Caffeine Sponsors

To all the coffee shops that fueled our late-night coding sessions and early morning bug fixes. Your caffeinated contributions will not be forgotten! ☕💻

## 🦥 The Sloth Mascot

Last but not least, a nod to our unofficial mascot, the sloth. You remind us daily that slow and steady wins the race, especially when you're too lazy to run it. 🦥💤

Remember, in the world of `gh-lazy`, being lazy isn't a bug, it's a feature! Keep calm and automate on! 🚀😴
